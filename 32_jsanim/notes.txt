DISCO

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* multiplying velocity by -1 makes it look like its reflecting off the wall

* Math.random() only returns a float from 0 to 1. you'd have to multiply by a bigger constant to get a useful number

=================================================================

QCC

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* what does preventDefault() mean? why doesnt it work? how do you make it work?

* do we need to make it change colors when it hits the corner?

* what does cancelAnimationFrame() do in the beginning of the draw functions?
