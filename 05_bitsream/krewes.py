Refactor Krewes to Read File
2022-09-28
time spent: 0.8 hr
DISCO:
* use open() to return the file in a file object
* use read() to read contents of file into a string
* set values to key by syntax dict[key]
QCC
* if we want to make the devo name the name of a array with the ducky inside the array, how would we do that?
* is there a pretty way to generalize our algorithm so we don't have to initialize the arrays for each period
  
OPS SUMMARY
    mkDict:
    - read your file into a string
    - split string by @@@ to split into each person
    - split each person by $$$ to split into pd, devo, ducky
    - add the information into the dictionary
    Choice:
    - use .choice on the list of keys
    - use .choice on the list corresponding to that key
